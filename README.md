We have created two tables user and hobbies 
user is having reference of hobbies in it whenever we are creating a user we add hobbies as well  the user has the ref of the hobbie unique id , which help us to map users and its different hobbies at same time

for example we 

method: get
url: http://localhost:9000/

result :
{
        "name": "Simran",
        "hobbies": [
            {
                "_id": "64bd7f60ac4163263544a9c3",
                "name": "Simran",
                "passionLevel": "high",
                "year": 2023,
                "__v": 0
            },
            {
                "_id": "64bd7f86ac4163263544a9c7",
                "name": "dancing",
                "passionLevel": "high",
                "year": 2023,
                "__v": 0
            }
        ]
    }

name is the unique key here hence when we add same user error ocurs
Response: {
    "error": "User already exists"
}

        "name":"dancing",
